## Our section just completed our first Advanced Excel Capstone Project, where we analyzed the Boston housing market using the full data analytics process: Explore, Prepare, Visualize, Model, and Summarize (EDA).

### My mission was to successfully demonstrate:

#### 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation: detecting and removing outliers, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency across 13 variables and 506 records.
#### 📊 Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: using histograms to visualize distributions and scatterplots to explore relationships between key variables.
#### 📈 Simple and Multiple Linear Regression: measuring correlation strength and identify the most influential predictors of home value.
#### 🔍 Hypothesis Testing: confirming statistical significance for each variable.
#### 🧠 Recommendations: Using data-driven Insights to suggest actions for home buyers, policy makers, and urban development planners.

This experience opened my eyes to how powerful structured data can be when cleaned and modeled effectively, and it strengthened my proficiency in Microsoft Excel for real-world analytics.
